# Greatest Common Factor

For your assignment over the weekend. You will be implementing a function that computes the greatest common factor between two numbers.


## What is a GCF? 

The GCF of two numbers is a single largest number that you can find that divides both numbers without remainders. 

The GCF of `15` and `20` is `5`.

The GCF of `93` and `57` is `3`.

## Constraints of the application:

Expect two numbers between 0 and 100.

The function must be callable like so:

```js
GCF(11, 77)
  // should return 11
```
